Q#1. Below are the three statements in the context of Hibernate Framework.

1) Hibernate is a database management system

2) The main configuration file for Hibernate is hibernate-config.xml

3) Hibernate is an ORM tool

Which of the following is a correct option?

A) Statements 2 & 3 are correct
B) All statements are correct
C) Statements 1 & 2 are incorrect
D) All statements are incorrect




A#1: C) Statements 1 & 2 are incorrect 

Explanation: Hibernate is not a database management system. The main configuration file for Hibernate is hibernate.cfg.xml (not the hibernate-config.xml), which contains database connection settings and other configurations. Also, Hibernate is an ORM tool for Java. Therefore, statements 1 & 2 are incorrect, while 3 is correct.

Q#2. Which statement is incorrect about the @Entity annotation in Hibernate?

A) It is a foundation for mapping Java objects to relational database tables.
B) It marks a class as an entity bean.
C) An entity annotated class instance corresponds to a single row in the mapped database table.
D) It creates a new database.

jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hib?createDbIfNotExists 


A#2: D) It creates a new database

Explanation: The @Entity annotation creates a new table in the database, but not a new database. Hence, option D is incorrect.

Q#3. What is the purpose of the SessionFactory in Hibernate?

A) To manage database connections
B) To create session objects
C) To generate SQL queries
D) To create entity beans



A#3: B) To create session objects

Explanation: The SessionFactory is used to create Session objects, which in turn manage the lifecycle and persistence of entities.

Q#4. Below are the three statements in the context of Hibernate Framework.

Hibernate can generate database schema based on mappings.
Hibernate does not support lazy fetching of associations.
Hibernate supports caching to improve performance.
Which of the following is the correct option?

A) Statements 1 & 3 are correct
B) All statements are correct
C) Statements 2 & 3 are incorrect
D) All statements are incorrect




A#12: A) Statements 1 & 3 are correct

Explanation: The Session interface in Hibernate provides methods for create, read, and delete operations. During Recent Migration, the Java Persistence API (JPA) is undergoing a specification move from Java EE to Jakarta EE, with the package name changing to jakarta.persistence from javax.persistence, which is the standard JPA (Java Persistence API) package. The @Table annotation specifies the table name for an entity in the database. Therefore, statements 1 & 3 are correct, while 2 is incorrect.
